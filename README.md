# The Bounded Harness

Bounded is a harness for coding agents. It gives an agent a structured way to
turn a request into working software, then checks the result with rules the
agent cannot simply talk past. The model and the agent application can change;
the instructions, workflow, and checks belong to the project.

Bounded currently supports [pi](https://pi.dev) and Claude Code. It uses the
agent you are already running. It does not start or bundle another agent.

## What happens in a Bounded project

1. **Initialize with your agent.** In an empty directory, ask your pi or
   Claude Code agent to “initialize Bounded here.” It runs `bounded init`,
   discusses the capabilities your product needs, and shows the files it will
   create before applying the plan.
2. **Work through defined roles.** Bounded supplies skills for recurring work
   and subagents for jobs that benefit from separation. In the developer
   workflow, an architect owns the specification and commissions a reviewer,
   a test writer, and a builder. The test writer does not see the builder's
   code; the builder does not see the tests while implementing.
3. **Let the host enforce boundaries.** Bounded connects to each agent host's
   hook layer. The adapter restricts tools and file writes according to the
   active role and phase. A blocked action is recorded; a role cannot advance
   merely by saying the previous step is complete.
4. **Run the same checks everywhere.** Project-local gates check the design,
   contract, tests, implementation, and delivery. The agent, a human at a
   terminal, and CI can run the same gate code. A review must exist before a
   design freezes, and a passing implementation is tied to the failing test
   run that preceded it.

The result is a project that carries its selected harness, instructions,
skills, agent definitions, hooks, and gates in its own repository. A fresh
clone installs its pinned dependencies with `npm run bounded:setup`; it does
not need the global installer to keep working.

## Why the separation matters

An agent that writes both the test and the code can accidentally grade its
own work. In early [dogfood runs](docs/dogfooding.md), two ordinary runs
independently produced an invariant test that could not fail. Separating the
test writer from the builder prevented that specific failure. Bounded adds
mechanical checks at each handoff so the process does not depend on an agent
remembering every instruction.

The longer-term direction is in [the vision](docs/VISION.md). The developer
workflow is described in [its design note](docs/tn/TN-26-001-developer-stage-pipeline.md).

## Try the local preview

The CLI is packaged locally but has no public one-command install URL yet.
From a harness checkout:

```bash
cd agent
npm ci
npm run publish:local
bounded --version
```

Then open an empty directory (or one containing only `.git/`) in pi or Claude
Code and ask the current agent to initialize Bounded there. The installed
`bounded` command handles initialization and version reporting. The new
project uses its own Bounded commands; for example:

```bash
npm run bounded:setup
bash .bounded/harness/scripts/bounded gates --list
```

For a terminal-led setup, `bounded init --interactive` asks the same choices.
The initializer refuses an existing project before writing files. Today it
can scaffold a TypeScript web application; the backend service capability is
available to the harness but does not yet have a complete new-project
scaffold. Public CLI distribution and updates to an already initialized
project are future work.
