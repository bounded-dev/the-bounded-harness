// Phase gate: a worker spawn is a transition, and transitions are checked.
//
// Every other gate checks an ARTIFACT — is this contract pure, is this red the
// right red. None of them checked the SEQUENCE, so a step could simply not be
// reached and nothing would notice. Across three consecutive dogfood attempts
// on one prompt the architect froze the contracts with no `spec.md` every time,
// and only wrote one afterwards because it happened to.
//
// The spec is not paperwork. It carries the half of the interface types cannot
// hold: execution order, the exact rounding tie-break, identity guarantees. A
// test-writer handed 38 typed operations and no spec can pin signatures and
// nothing else — which is exactly the class of test the bare arm already
// writes, and the harness's whole measured advantage lives in the difference.
//
// So the spawn itself is gated. Commissioning a worker is a tool call, the path
// gate already sees every tool call, and a spawn whose preconditions are unmet
// is refused. The rule stops being "the skill says do this first" and becomes
// something with no way around it.
//
// Evidence comes from the guard log, which every gate already writes. That
// makes the log load-bearing rather than merely diagnostic: it is the record of
// what actually ran, so it is the right thing to ask.
//
// WHAT THE GATE CHECKS, AND WHAT IT NO LONGER DOES (ADR 2026-021)
//
// The precondition for a worker is the FREEZE, not the red. red_gate proves red
// in a shadow project it builds itself — contracts plus regenerated skeletons
// plus the tests tree, never the live `src/` — and green_gate requires the
// standing red to match the current tests-tree hash. So a red is bound to the
// bytes it was proven against rather than to a moment in the run, and
// sequencing the builder behind it bought nothing the hashes do not already
// hold. The test-writer and the builder are therefore commissioned in parallel
// once DESIGN is complete, and nothing here enforces an order between them.
//
// Two spawn SHAPES are refused outright, because both were observed live
// carrying pipeline work past every check in this file:
//
//   * a multi-spawn form (`workflowScript`, or a `chain`/`parallel` item array)
//     that names a pipeline role — the gate sees one tool call and cannot
//     evaluate a precondition per child inside a script it never watches run,
//     and the per-role model tier is injected at the plain spawn too;
//   * `delegate`, the general write-capable worker, in a session that already
//     holds a bound role — inside the developer stage every writer is a role
//     with a zone, and an unbound one writes wherever it likes.
//
// RESUMES ARE COMMISSIONS TOO (r15)
//
// A third shape was passing through untouched: `action: "resume"`. r15's kimi
// architect made twelve of them and not one produced a phase-gate or a
// model-tier event, so twelve seats went back to work with nothing in the log
// to say which roles were running or on what. A resume is not a launch — the
// child already exists, its preconditions were checked when it was launched,
// and refusing one would strand a run — but it IS a seat being commissioned,
// and it is recorded as one. Where the call names a role, the two refusals
// that are about the SHAPE of a commission rather than its phase apply
// unchanged: `delegate` holds no role binding whether it is starting or
// continuing, and a multi-spawn form is still a set of children this gate
// cannot see. Where it names only a run id — the ordinary case, since
// pi-subagents resolves the agent from the persisted run record and not from
// the input — the event carries the run id and the role `unknown`, which is
// strictly better than silence.
//
// AND A TIER THAT CANNOT RESOLVE IS A REFUSAL (r15)
//
// r15's first kimi reviewer ran on the session default, because the project's
// configured `kimi-k3:high` matched nothing in the live registry. The tier
// injection skipped, correctly — pi-subagents throws on an unresolvable
// explicit model — and the spawn then went ahead anyway, which is the part
// that was wrong: a judgment seat ran on a model nobody chose, silently. So a
// spawn whose role HAS a configured tier that the registry cannot resolve is
// refused here instead. The never-fatal rule for the config itself is
// untouched: no file, no key, a malformed file, or no registry snapshot all
// mean no policy, and no policy means allowed.
