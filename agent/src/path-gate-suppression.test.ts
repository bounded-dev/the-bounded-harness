// THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR (dogfood Run 6, 2026-09-02)
//
// A subagent installs TWO path-gate hooks, and neither knows about the other:
//
//   1. the BOUND hook, from its frontmatter `subagentOnlyExtensions`
//      (extensions/path-gate/test-writer.ts → installPathGate(pi, "test-writer"))
//   2. the AMBIENT hook, because extensions/path-gate.ts auto-loads in EVERY
//      pi session — including a child — and resolves its role from
//      `.pi/dev-stage-role` in the project cwd, which the child SHARES with
//      its parent.
//
// So when the parent session is gated as `architect` through that file, the
// child gets architect's zone applied on top of its own. Both hooks run on
// every tool call and either may block, so the child is confined to the
// INTERSECTION — and the architect may not write `tests/**`.
//
// Live consequence: the test-writer was refused permission to write its own
// tests, with the message "architect may not write 'tests/start.test.ts'". It
// correctly reported "a mismatch between my active_agent tag as test-writer
// and the gate treating me as architect", escalated, and the run deadlocked at
// the first worker.
//
// Restrictions must never leak DOWNWARD. A child's role is decided by its
// parent at spawn, from a file outside the project; that binding wins, and the
// ambient guess stands down in any process where a bound role was installed.
