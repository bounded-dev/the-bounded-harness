// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// Every gate so far checks an ARTIFACT — is this contract pure, is this red the
// right red. Nothing checked the SEQUENCE, so the architect could simply not
// reach a step and no machinery would notice. Across three consecutive dogfood
// attempts on the same prompt it froze the contracts with no `spec.md` every
// single time, and only wrote one afterwards because it happened to.
//
// That matters more than a missing file: the spec is the half of the interface
// types cannot hold — execution order, the exact rounding tie-break, identity
// guarantees. A test-writer handed 38 typed operations and no spec can pin
// signatures and nothing else, which is precisely the class of test the bare
// arm already writes. The harness's whole advantage lives in that document.
//
// So the transition itself becomes deterministic: spawning a worker is a tool
// call, the path gate already sees every tool call, and a spawn whose
// preconditions are unmet is refused. Not "the skill says do this first" —
// there is no way to skip it.
