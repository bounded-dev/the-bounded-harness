// Host declaration — which capability constraints the running host enforces
// (ADR 2026-034).
//
// Artifact gates answer the same whatever runs them; capability constraints
// (the tool strip, the path gate, the phase gate on spawns, the role-scoped
// worker views) only hold where a host cooperates. A run therefore has to
// say WHICH host it ran under and what that host enforced, or a `bounded gates`
// transcript from a bare shell reads exactly like a blind run: same gates,
// same verdicts, no blindness at all. The declaration is one guard-log event,
// written by the host adapter as the session binds a role (pi: `session_start`;
// Claude Code: the first hook call) and by the CLI when nothing declared
// before it. It is recorded on CHANGE, not once: a bare `bounded gates` before a
// pi session starts records `none`, and the session then records `pi`, so
// the log tells the truth about every stretch of the run.
//
// Pure apart from the one logging call, which reuses the guard log's own
// never-throw boundary.
