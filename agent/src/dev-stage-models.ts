// Two model tiers for the developer-stage pipeline (issue #13, "Speed the seats").
//
// The pipeline has four seats and they are not the same kind of work. The
// ARCHITECT and the REVIEWER make judgments — what the interface should be,
// what the spec must pin, whether the design holds. Runs 10–12 showed design
// quality tracks the model, so those two are where thinking is worth buying.
// The TEST-WRITER and the BUILDER produce against a frozen contract and a
// written spec: the judgment has already been made, and their output is
// volume. Paying design prices for volume is how a 35-minute run happens.
//
// So: two named parameters, not four.
//
//   designModel  → architect, reviewer      (the judgment seats)
//   workerModel  → test-writer, builder     (the production seats)
//
// pi's model pattern carries the thinking level as a suffix
// (`provider/model:<level>`, levels off|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|max —
// see pi-subagents' `splitKnownThinkingSuffix`), so ONE string sets both the
// model and how hard it thinks. That is why this is two parameters and not
// four: the tier is the whole setting.
//
// ── What is harness-owned and what is per-project ────────────────────────
//
// The role→tier MAPPING is harness-owned: it is a statement about what each
// seat does, which does not vary by project. `TIER_BY_ROLE` below is that
// statement, and a drift test pins its keys to the path policy's roster so a
// fifth seat cannot be added without deciding which tier it belongs to.
//
// The VALUES are per-project, because which model is worth its price depends
// on the codebase, the budget, and what the provider offers this week. They
// live in `<project>/.pi/dev-stage-models.json`, next to `.pi/dev-stage-role`
// and the guard log — the same per-project `.pi/` directory every other piece
// of run state already uses.
//
//   { "designModel": "anthropic/claude-opus-4:high",
//     "workerModel": "fireworks/kimi-k3-fast:medium" }
//
// ── Never fatal ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A missing file, a missing key, an unreadable file, a malformed one: all mean
// "no override" — the seat runs on the session default, exactly as it did
// before this file existed. A config that cannot be parsed produces warnings
// and is ignored. This is deliberate and it is the one hard rule here: a
// broken speed knob must never cost a run. Everything a gate refuses is
// refused because proceeding would produce a WRONG result; running the builder
// on the session default instead of the configured tier produces a right
// result more slowly, which is not a reason to stop.
//
// That is also why unknown keys warn rather than being ignored silently: the
// realistic failure is `designmodel` or `design_model`, which would otherwise
// do nothing at all with no way to notice.
//
// This module is pure apart from `readDevStageModels`, which is a thin
// never-throwing file read. The spawn-time injection and the guard-log
// boundary live in model-tier.ts.
