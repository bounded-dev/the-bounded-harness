// Model-tier injection: the point where a seat's tier becomes the model that
// actually runs (issue #13, "Speed the seats").
//
// dev-stage-models.ts decides WHAT each seat should run on. This module is the
// trust boundary that makes it happen and records that it happened. Pure cores
// never log; the wiring layer does — the same split guard-log.ts,
// path-gate.ts and dev-tools.ts already follow.
//
// ── The mechanism, and why this one ──────────────────────────────────────
//
// Subagents are launched by the `subagent` tool from pi-subagents@0.52.1. Its
// top-level parameter schema (src/extension/schemas.ts) carries an optional
// `model`: "Default child model override. Full provider/id values are
// accepted." That value reaches
// `resolveEffectiveSubagentModel(params.model, agentConfig.model, parentModel,
// …)` (src/runs/foreground/subagent-executor.ts), where an explicit parameter
// beats agent frontmatter, which beats `subagents.agentOverrides`, which beats
// `subagents.defaultModel`, which beats the parent session's model. A `:high`
// style suffix on that string sets the child's thinking level
// (src/shared/model-info.ts, `splitKnownThinkingSuffix`). So one string on one
// parameter sets both halves of a tier.
//
// pi's `tool_call` extension hook makes `event.input` MUTABLE — "Mutate it in
// place to patch tool arguments before execution" (pi-coding-agent
// dist/core/extensions/types.d.ts). That is the whole mechanism: when a spawn
// names a pipeline role, put the tier's pattern on `input.model` before the
// tool runs.
//
// The alternatives were considered and rejected. Agent frontmatter `model:` is
// real and would work, but the values are per-project and the agent files are
// harness-global — one project's budget would become every project's. Settings
// `subagents.agentOverrides.<role>.model` has the same problem in the user
// settings file, and putting it in each project's `.pi/settings.json` means
// every project must know the harness's role names. The config file this reads
// keeps the role→tier mapping harness-owned and only the values per-project.
//
// ── The tier is policy, not a default ────────────────────────────────────
//
// When a tier IS configured for a seat, it beats a `model` the caller passed:
// seat models are harness-owned policy, and an architect that could hand its
// builder a different model per spawn would make the tier a suggestion — the
// exact prose-vs-mechanism failure this harness exists to close. The
// replacement is loud, not silent: the guard event records the discarded
// value, so a spawn that tried to choose is visible in the log. A caller's
// model stands only where the project set no tier for that seat.
//
// A model the live registry does not know is NOT injected. pi-subagents throws
// `Unknown subagent model '<x>'` on an unresolvable explicit model, which would
// turn a stale config line into a dead run — precisely the failure mode the
// config's never-fatal rule exists to prevent. When the registry snapshot is
// unavailable (empty), validation is skipped rather than assumed to fail: no
// snapshot is not evidence of a bad model.
//
// ── A RESUME CANNOT BE TIERED, AND THAT IS pi-subagents' RULE ────────────
//
// r15's kimi architect made twelve `subagent` resume calls. None of them
// produced a model-tier event, and the reason is not an oversight here: a
// resume does not accept a model at all. `resumeAsyncRun`
// (pi-subagents 0.52.1, src/runs/foreground/subagent-executor.ts) refuses one
// outright, before it does anything else:
//
//     if (input.params.model !== undefined) {
//       return { content: [{ type: "text", text:
//         "action='resume' reuses the persisted child model and does not
//          accept a model override." }], isError: true, … };
//     }
//
// The `model` field is on the tool's flat top-level parameter schema
// (src/extension/schemas.ts, `SubagentParamProperties`) — one schema serves
// launches and management actions alike — so it is SCHEMA-legal and
// RUNTIME-refused. Injecting a tier into a resume would therefore not downtier
// the seat, it would kill the call. The child's model comes from the persisted
// run record instead (`AsyncResumeTarget.model` / `.thinking`, read back from
// the async result file in src/runs/background/async-resume.ts), which is the
// tier it was LAUNCHED on.
//
// So the rule is: a resumed seat keeps the tier of its launch, and there is
// nothing to inject. That is fine when the launch was tiered and invisible
// when it was not — which is exactly why a resume logs a NOTE here rather than
// nothing at all. Twelve silent resumes are twelve seats no reader can account
// for.
//
// ── What this cannot reach ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// * A `workflowScript` spawn names its children inside a JavaScript string,
//   so the target role is not visible in the tool input. The top-level `model`
//   parameter IS forwarded to workflow children as their default, but with no
//   readable role there is no tier to choose, so those spawns are left alone.
// * A ROOT session that is itself a pipeline role — `pi` in a directory whose
//   `.bounded/dev-stage-role` says `architect`, which is how the dogfood harnessed
//   arm runs — was never spawned through this tool, so its model is whatever
//   the session was launched with. Only spawned seats are tiered.
