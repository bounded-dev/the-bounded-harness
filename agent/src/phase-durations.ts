// Phase-duration telemetry (issue #13): where a run's minutes actually went.
//
// Every gate already timestamps itself into the guard log, so the shape of a
// run — how long DESIGN took, how many times TEST bounced, whether BUILD was
// the expensive part — is already recorded. It was simply never read back.
// "Measure before optimizing further" needs that read-back to exist, and it
// needs it to come from logged data rather than from anyone's recollection of
// the session.
//
// This module is the read-back: pure analysis over `readonly LoggedGuardEvent[]`,
// no I/O, no logging. It lives beside guard-log.ts rather than in packs/ts
// because a guard log is language-agnostic — a Python pack would emit the same
// event stream and deserve the same report. The caller supplies the events
// (`deliver` reads the target project's log and prints the block).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The four phases and the markers that end them
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Phases are contiguous: each begins where the previous one ended, and each is
// closed by a marker that already exists in the log. The vocabulary is the
// phase gate's (`phase-gate.ts`) and green-gate's, deliberately — a second
// spelling of "the contract is frozen" would be a second, drifting definition
// of the DESIGN boundary.
//
//   DESIGN  first event                 → the freeze
//   TESTS   the test-writer's first      → the first `red-gate` pass
//           event, else the freeze
//   BUILD   the builder's first event,   → the first `green-gate` pass after it
//           else the first `red-gate` pass
//   WRAP    the first `green-gate` pass  → the last `sign-off`/`deliver` event
//
// WHERE A WORKER'S PHASE OPENS (r15)
//
// The gate markers say when a phase ENDED; only the workers themselves say
// when one began. Opening BUILD at the red-gate pass — the marker that closes
// TESTS — makes the two phases meet at a single event by construction, so the
// spans can touch but never overlap, and the parallel-workers row below could
// not fire on any log this analysis produced. That is a measurement lost to an
// artefact of the boundary, not to the run: the test-writer and the builder
// are commissioned in parallel (ADR 2026-021), and "tests 8m37s then build
// 5m42s" reads as 14m19s of sequence when the wall clock was 12m19s.
//
// So each worker phase opens at the first event ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT WORKER.
// Two guards already carry the attribution and neither was added for this:
//
//   · `typecheck` events carry `detail.role` — the tool scopes its diagnostics
//     by the calling role, from the same binding the path gate acts on;
//   · `run_tests` events are the BUILDER's by construction, because run_tests
//     is builder-only (path-policy.ts) and enforced as such.
//
// The search runs from the freeze forward, so a worker event from an earlier
// ticket in a shared log cannot pull a boundary back behind the design that
// produced it, and the gate markers remain the fallback: a run whose workers
// logged nothing attributable measures exactly as it did before. The phase
// ENDS are untouched — a phase still ends where its gate says it ended.
//
// Two consequences, both accepted:
//
// * THE PHASES STOP BEING CONTIGUOUS when a worker opens its own. The minutes
//   between the freeze and the test-writer's first call are the architect's,
//   spent commissioning; billing them to TESTS was never right, and `totalMs`
//   still measures the whole run, so the gap is visible as the phases failing
//   to sum rather than hidden inside one of them.
// * PARTIAL ATTRIBUTION UNDERSTATES a phase: a builder that reads for ten
//   minutes before its first typecheck opens BUILD ten minutes late. The
//   fallback covers no attribution at all, not half of it. Worth knowing when
//   reading an old log — r15's own predates role-scoped typecheck, so only its
//   `run_tests` events are attributable — and self-correcting as the guards
//   that carry a role stay the ones workers reach for first.
//
// Block attribution is deliberately NOT moved with these boundaries. Blocks
// are placed by index between the gate markers (see "Bounces" below), which is
// what keeps a bounce on the line of the phase whose gate handed it back; the
// spans and the block regions have never been the same intervals (DESIGN's
// span already opens at the run-start marker while its region opens at the top
// of the log).
//
// "The freeze" is a `checksum-gate` pass whose summary says it wrote the
// manifest, or a `design-gate` pass (ADR 2026-019's composite, whose final
// step IS that write). Both fire on a composite run, milliseconds apart; taking
// the LAST freeze collapses them to one boundary. A `checksum-gate` pass that
// merely VERIFIED ("no drift") is not a freeze and must not be mistaken for
// one — that is the `check_drift` tool, which the architect may run at any
// point in the run.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Edge semantics — every one of these is a decision, not an accident
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// * PHASES THAT NEVER COMPLETED report `ms: undefined`, never 0. A run that
//   died in TEST did not spend zero minutes building; nothing is known about
//   its BUILD, and a zero would be a measurement it never made. Each such
//   phase carries `incomplete`, naming the earliest marker that is missing, so
//   the report says which step never happened rather than just "unknown".
//
// * MULTIPLE FREEZES (contract revised mid-loop, re-frozen, ADR 2026-019's
//   re-run path): DESIGN extends to the LAST freeze that precedes the first
//   `red-gate` pass. A revision means the design was not finished at the first
//   freeze — the minutes spent revising are design minutes, and the freeze the
//   eventual red actually validated is the one that ended the phase. A freeze
//   AFTER the first red pass (Run 10's mid-loop revision) does not extend
//   DESIGN: by then TEST and BUILD are underway, and stretching DESIGN over
//   them would double-count the same wall clock. With no red pass at all,
//   DESIGN ends at the last freeze in the log — there is nothing downstream to
//   pin it against.
//
// * MARKERS ARE FOUND IN APPEND ORDER, NOT TIMESTAMP ORDER. The log is an
//   append-only file written by one gate at a time, so its order is the causal
//   truth of what ran; a system clock can be adjusted mid-run and a timestamp
//   cannot be trusted to sequence anything. Timestamps are used only to
//   measure spans whose endpoints append order has already fixed, and a span
//   that comes out negative (a clock that went backwards) is clamped to 0
//   rather than reported as a negative duration.
//
// * EVENTS WITH NO USABLE TIMESTAMP are dropped and counted (`skipped`).
//   `readGuardLog` already drops unparseable LINES; a parseable line whose
//   `ts` is missing or not a date is corrupt in the same way, and an event
//   that cannot be placed on the clock cannot bound a span.
//
// * MORE THAN ONE RUN IN A LOG: still taken as one run — but no longer blind
//   to where the run began. The path gate logs a `run-start` event at the
//   first gated tool call of a session (see "The clock" below), so a log that
//   carries one is measured from there. Without one (an ungated session, a log
//   written before the marker existed) the first event of a run is whichever
//   gate the architect happened to call first, indistinguishable from any
//   other event, and the headline says so. A project that puts two tickets
//   through the pipeline without clearing `.pi/` still gets one merged report;
//   the DESIGN rule above absorbs the common case (revision inside one
//   ticket), and a genuine second ticket shows as an implausible total, which
//   is a visible symptom rather than a silent wrong answer.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The clock: where the run starts (r15)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Both r15 arms lost about fourteen minutes to a provider outage between the
// session opening and the prompt actually landing, and DESIGN silently ate it:
// 55m and 80m were logged for design phases that really took ~33m and ~58m.
// The first event in the log was the path gate's session-start tool strip —
// stamped when the session opened, which is not when the run started.
//
// So the path gate logs a `run-start` event at the FIRST gated tool call it
// evaluates in a session: the first moment the run is demonstrably doing work.
// When one is present the clock starts there — DESIGN opens at it, `totalMs`
// measures from it, and the headline names the time so the reader can see
// which minutes were excluded. When none is present nothing changes, and the
// old "taken as one run" caveat stands.
//
// Two decisions worth naming:
//
// * MULTIPLE RUN-STARTS (a session restarted, a provider outage re-opened the
//   session) take the LAST one BEFORE the first phase marker. Everything
//   before that marker is still setup; the final restart is the attempt that
//   actually produced the run. A run-start appearing AFTER the first marker
//   belongs to a second run in a shared log and is ignored — moving the clock
//   there would put the start of the report after its own DESIGN phase.
//
// * THE CLOCK MOVES, NOT THE ATTRIBUTION. Blocks are still placed in phases by
//   index from the top of the log, so a refusal logged before the first gated
//   call still lands on DESIGN's line. It happened during the design phase; it
//   simply happened during minutes nobody was working, and hiding it would
//   lose a refusal to make an arithmetic identity tidier.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Bounces
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// A bounce is a hand-back to a role, and the log's own marker for that is the
// `route` a gate records in its event detail — the machine-readable twin of
// the single `route → <role>` line it prints. So: a BOUNCE is a `block` event
// carrying `detail.route`.
//
// Counting every `block` instead would double-count, because composite gates
// and their steps both log: a design-gate failure writes a `contract-purity`
// block AND a `design-gate` block, and a green-gate escape-hatch failure
// writes a `lint-src` block AND a `green-gate` block. One hand-back, two
// events. Those inner blocks — and `path-gate` denials, which refuse a single
// tool call rather than returning work to anyone — are still counted, as
// `unroutedBlocks`, so nothing disappears from the report.
//
// A block lands in a phase by INDEX, not by timestamp, for the same reason
// markers do. A block that falls in a stretch no pair of markers delimits is
// `unattributedBlocks`: with the boundary unknown it genuinely is not known
// which phase it belongs to, and guessing would put TEST's bounces on DESIGN's
// line.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Friction vs iteration: two very different things that both log a block
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// A bounce is work handed back on purpose: a gate found a defect and named
// whose it is. An UNROUTED block — one carrying no `detail.route` — is not one
// thing but two, and r15 proved that conflating them makes the headline lie.
// That run printed `friction: 31 unrouted blocks (typecheck 13, run_tests 8,
// git 4, …)`, which reads as a harness fighting its own workers. The
// transcripts said otherwise: all 21 typecheck/run_tests blocks were workers
// compiling and running their own suites and seeing red, which is the job, and
// the git blocks were archaeology that found nothing. Exactly ONE call was
// refused in the whole run.
//
//   REFUSAL   a guard said "you may not": the call did not happen. `path-gate`
//             (out-of-zone read or write), `phase-gate` (a spawn too early),
//             and any other gate block that names no route — including a
//             composite's inner step, such as the `contract-purity` block that
//             accompanies a routed `design-gate` block. Target: zero.
//
//   ITERATION a worker's own dev tool reported a red state: the call happened
//             and told the truth. `typecheck`, `run_tests`, `lint-*`. A
//             builder whose typecheck never errors is not iterating, it is
//             guessing. Target: whatever the work needs.
//
// The split is decided by GUARD NAME alone. The alternative — inferring the
// caller from the event — would need a provenance field no guard writes, and
// the guard name is already the thing that determines who logged it.
//
// Judgment calls, all three of them:
//
// * `git` is ITERATION. A non-zero git exit is `git log` on a path that never
//   existed — a search that missed, not a refusal. Counting it as friction
//   would put "the harness got in the way" on the architect's own archaeology,
//   which is what r15 did (4 of its 31).
//
// * `lint-src` / `lint-tests` are ITERATION wherever they are logged, worker
//   tool call or inner step of a gate. A lint block is always a report about
//   the code; when it is an inner step, the composite's OWN block carries the
//   route and is already counted as the bounce. Any future `lint-*` guard
//   inherits this by prefix rather than by being added to a list.
//
// * A composite's non-lint inner steps (`contract-purity`, and anything else
//   that blocks with no route) stay REFUSALS. They are a gate declining to
//   proceed, which is the same act path-gate performs; the vocabulary should
//   not change with the guard's position in a composite.
//
// Both tallies are kept, per phase and per run, and both are reported: the
// `friction:` line counts refusals only and keeps its target of zero, while
// `iteration:` prints the red-loops as the normal work they are. As before,
// the RUN totals include blocks no pair of markers could place — a denial in
// an unmeasurable stretch cost exactly what one inside DESIGN cost, and
// dropping it would make the headline disagree with the log.

// parallel it can be 12m19s of wall clock, and the difference is the whole
// point of running them that way.
//
// So when the two spans genuinely overlap, they print as ONE row measured
// from the union of the two windows, with the individual figures kept in the
// brackets and the full per-phase rows kept in the structured summary the
// caller logs. A run whose spans do not overlap prints exactly what it always
// did — the row is a description of what the timestamps say, never a claim
// about how the run was configured.
//
// Two constraints this obeys:
//
// * IT READS ONLY THE SPAN TIMESTAMPS the analysis already produces. No new
//   event kind, no inference about which worker owned which tool call.
//
// * A BACKWARDS CLOCK IS NOT AN OVERLAP. A span whose end precedes its start
//   (the clamped case the header describes) is not a window at all, and two
//   of them can "overlap" in arithmetic that means nothing. Such a pair falls
//   back to the ordinary rows.
//
// The boundaries now produce those overlaps from a real log: BUILD opens at the
// builder's first attributable event rather than at the red-gate pass that
// closes TESTS (see "Where a worker's phase opens" in the header), so two
// workers commissioned in parallel show as two overlapping windows and this row
// fires. The formatter still takes the spans as given and asserts nothing about
// adjacency — it describes what the timestamps say, never how the run was
// configured, and a genuinely sequential run prints exactly what it always did.
