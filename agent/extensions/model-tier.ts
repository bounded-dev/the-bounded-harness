/**
 * Model-tier extension (issue #13, "Speed the seats").
 *
 * A `tool_call` hook that patches the `model` argument of a `subagent` spawn
 * so each pipeline seat runs on its project's tier: architect and reviewer on
 * `designModel`, test-writer and builder on `workerModel`. Every other agent —
 * scout, product-expert, delegate, anything unmapped — is untouched, and so is
 * every session whose project has no `.pi/dev-stage-models.json`.
 *
 * All of the decision lives in ../src/model-tier.ts (which is testable without
 * pi) and ../src/dev-stage-models.ts (the config reader). This file is the
 * pi-facing wiring and nothing else.
 *
 * ── Why a hook of its own ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The path gate already intercepts `subagent` calls, but only for a session
 * that HOLDS a pipeline role, because that is what it gates. Tiering has to
 * work one level up as well: whoever launches the architect — an orchestrator,
 * a team lead, a plain session — holds no role, so the path gate's hook is
 * inactive there and would never see the spawn. This hook is unconditional
 * instead, and decides purely from the spawn's target.
 *
 * Both hooks may fire on the same call. Order does not matter: this one only
 * mutates arguments and never blocks, and pi's contract is that later
 * `tool_call` handlers see earlier mutations. A spawn the phase gate goes on
 * to refuse leaves a `model-tier` pass followed by a `phase-gate` block, which
 * reads correctly — the tier was chosen, the spawn was not allowed.

 * snapshot, which the planner treats as "cannot tell" rather than "bad".
