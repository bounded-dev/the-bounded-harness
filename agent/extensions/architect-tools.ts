/**
 * Architect tools (issue #12): the gates, and git.
 *
 * The architect drives a whole ticket but holds NO `bash` — a shell defeats
 * every path rule at once, so it gets named tools for the things it
 * legitimately needs instead of a way to run anything. This file is what makes
 * that trade survivable: every capability the architect actually needs exists
 * here, or it cannot do its job.
 *
 * The gate tools are not written here. They come from the gate registry
 * (`packs/ts/gates.ts`, ADR 2026-029) through `lib/gate-tools.ts`: one entry
 * per gate carries the name, description, flags and prompt guidance, and this
 * extension only says WHICH entries the architect holds — `GATE_TOOLS` from
 * the path policy, plus `mutation_score`. `pi-gates` reads the same entries
 * for its command line, so a gate cannot differ by how it was invoked. That
 * matters more than it sounds: "the architect runs every gate itself and
 * never trusts a worker's word" is worth nothing if the tool is a second,
 * drifting implementation of the gate — and before the registry, the verdict
 * line, the cwd rule and the descriptions were exactly such copies.
 *
 * Two things the named tools buy beyond closing the shell:
 *
 *   · The invocation guidance deletes itself. Dogfood Run 4's orchestrator
 *     spent its first ~3 minutes `find`-ing the pack and `head`-ing three gate
 *     scripts to work out how to call them, then re-read two of them mid-run.
 *     A tool schema cannot be mis-invoked that way, and `design_gate` finds
 *     the contracts itself rather than taking one path per call.
 *   · Every gate lands in the guard log by construction, so "did the architect
 *     actually run the gate" is checkable rather than trusted.
 *
 * The roster is deliberately not one tool per gate script. Where several gates
 * have exactly one legal order, they are one tool: `design_gate` is
 * purity → scaffold → typecheck → design-review → freeze in a single call with
 * a single verdict (ADR 2026-019, ADR 2026-020), because the order used to live
 * in prose and prose executes unreliably. `contract_purity` survives alongside it as the cheap
 * single check while a contract is still being iterated on.
 *
 * Two of the tools here are not gates and decide nothing.
 *
 *   · `sleep` exists because r15's architect had no way to pass time. Its
 *     reviewer stalled, and with a stalled child, no wait primitive and a
 *     standing instruction not to busy-loop, it reached for the only thing
 *     that blocked: it ran `design_gate` five times as a clock, writing four
 *     junk scaffolds, and said so out loud — "Since I have no sleep mechanism
 *     and shouldn't busy-loop, calling design_gate itself serves as a
 *     legitimate poll". A gate run is a claim about the project's state, so a
 *     run made to fill a gap corrupts the only record of what happened. The
 *     fix is not a paragraph asking it to stop; it is a primitive that waits.
 *     It is a host utility, not an artifact gate, so it is written here.
 *   · `mutation_score` exists because both r15 arms' surviving mutants mapped
 *     exactly onto their prompts' headline rules — the measurement was
 *     available and nobody could run it. It is advisory by construction
 *     (exit 0 means it ran, whatever the score), so it never blocks a phase;
 *     it is here so the architect can take the measurement before it signs
 *     off rather than after the run is over. It inspects the tree, so it is
 *     a registry entry like the gates.
 *
 * `git` is deliberately unrestricted. Archaeology — reflog, bisect, blame — is
 * exactly when a closed verb list becomes a cage, and it is exactly when you
 * need the tool most. The safety story is not "restrict the verb": it is that
 * the two blind roles hold no git at all (`git show HEAD:tests/x.test.ts`
 * would hand the builder the test source in one call), that args are passed as
 * an array and spawned directly so this tool is not itself an injection point,
 * and that every invocation is logged.
