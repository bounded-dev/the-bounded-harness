// TN-26-001 architect zone rule: branded TYPE ALIASES are banned in contracts —
// the nominal class is the only value-object form the system can keep honest.
//
// Run 9 is why. Under escape-hatch pressure (`as` is banned in src/), the
// architect rewrote every value object as
//
//   export type Currency = string & { readonly __brand?: 'Currency' };
//
// and every gate passed. The OPTIONAL brand makes any bare string assignable —
// the brand is a costume, nominality is zero — and because no exported class
// existed, value-object-shape stayed silent, no law suite was generated, and
// the boundaries obligation never fired. The whole coverage machinery was
// disarmed by a question mark.
//
// Banning only the optional form would not fix it, because the REQUIRED form
// is incoherent under the same regime: `raw as Currency` is the only way to
// construct a required-brand alias, and the src lint bans `as` with no
// exemption list. A contract demanding what the builder cannot legally write
// is a deadlock by design. The class has a real constructor; it is the only
// value-object shape that needs no escape hatch, which is precisely why it is
// canonical (see ts-contract-authoring, "The canonical shape is a nominal
// class").
//
// TRIGGER (deterministic on purpose): an exported type alias whose type is an
// intersection containing BOTH a primitive keyword (string | number | bigint)
// AND an object-literal member — the branded-alias pattern, optional or not.
// Ordinary object-type aliases, unions, and interfaces are untouched.
// no-naked-primitives still deliberately never enters intersections; this rule
// is why it no longer needs to.
