// red gate (TN-26-001, TEST → BUILD boundary, §"Test-runner gates").
//
//   node red-gate.ts [targetDir]
//
// Runs the target project's vitest suite (JSON reporter, via the shared
// run_tests suite runner) AND `tsc --noEmit`, and asserts a VALID red: the
// project TYPECHECKS, the suite RUNS, at least
// one test fails, and EVERY failure is a NotImplementedError. Red only proves
// something if someone checks WHY it went red (see TN-26-001 Appendix,
// Böckeler). Wrong-reason red — import errors, config errors, type/runtime
// errors, ordinary assertion failures — is REJECTED, naming the offending
// test. A fully-passing suite at the red phase is ALSO a fail: nothing is
// waiting to be built.
//
// RED ALSO REQUIRES A TYPE-CLEAN PROJECT (issue #7). In Run 3 two type errors
// in a test file survived the whole TEST phase and only surfaced after a
// (false) green — by which point the only role that could fix them, the
// test-writer, had long been handed off. tests/** type errors are the
// test-writer's to fix and this is the last gate where that is cheap, so
// catch them here and print one greppable `route → <role>` line.
//
// THE GATE RUNS AGAINST A SHADOW PROJECT, NOT THE LIVE TREE. The verdict
// "every failure is a NotImplementedError" is only measurable against an
// unimplemented skeleton, so running on the live tree made red impossible the
// moment the builder wrote anything — which is why BUILD had to wait for TEST,
// and why the r13/r14 runs jammed with an implemented tree and no way back to
// red short of re-freezing the contracts to wipe src/. `scaffold` is
// deterministic and the contracts are checksum-frozen, so the skeleton can be
// reproduced at will: the gate rebuilds one at `<project>/.bounded/shadow-red/`
// from the contracts, the tests and the config, and runs every check there.
// The verdict then holds regardless of what src/ contains, so the test-writer
// and the builder are PARALLEL workers over disjoint write zones (tests/ and
// src/) rather than a sequence.
//
// Exit 0 valid red · 1 invalid red (one greppable line each) · 2 misuse
// (target unrunnable / bad invocation). Logs one guard event to the target's
// .bounded/guard-log.jsonl, carrying the contract manifest and the tests-tree hash
// the verdict was made against — green binds itself to both (green-gate.ts).
//
// The suite and tsc commands are injectable for testing via BOUNDED_GATE_TEST_CMD /
// BOUNDED_GATE_TEST_ARGS and BOUNDED_GATE_TSC_CMD / BOUNDED_GATE_TSC_ARGS (JSON arrays);
// defaults are `npx vitest run --reporter=json` and `npx tsc --noEmit`.
