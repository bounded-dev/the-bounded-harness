// Typecheck routing (TN-26-001, issue #7).
//
// A passing suite with tsc errors is a FALSE GREEN (dogfood Run 3: green-gate
// said 22/22 while two `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` errors sat in the test
// file). Type errors are therefore a phase-gate failure — but "the project
// does not compile" is only actionable if the gate also says WHO can fix it:
// the builder is blind to `tests/**` and the path gate would refuse its edit
// anyway, so a test-file type error must bounce to the test-writer, not to
// whoever happens to be running.
//
// Pure: parses redacted tsc diagnostics (see typecheck.ts), attributes each to
// the role whose write zone owns the file, and picks one bounce target.
