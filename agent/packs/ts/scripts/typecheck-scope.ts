// Typecheck scoping — the blindness half of the `typecheck` worker tool
// (dogfood Run 15).
//
// `run_tests` is sanitized and the path gate refuses a worker's read of the
// other zone, but `typecheck` returned RAW project-wide diagnostics to every
// caller — so the tool was a hole in the wall the other two layers build.
// Run 15's transcripts show it leaking in BOTH directions with shipped-code
// consequences:
//
//   · the builder read `tests/billing.test.ts(5,3): … declares 'CalendarDate'
//     locally, but it is not exported` out of its own typecheck, reasoned
//     "tests are importing value objects from billing.js … billing.ts needs to
//     re-export", and added that re-export block. Implementation shaped to
//     test source it may never read — and it shipped.
//   · the test-writer read the builder's in-progress implementation the same
//     way ("the current src/billing/billing.ts is stale: it implements the new
//     parse* parsers but returns the old values.ts nominal types").
//
// So a worker's typecheck is SCOPED BY ITS ROLE, using the same ownership
// function the gates route with (ownerOfPath) and the same read decision the
// path gate enforces (decide). Diagnostics in the caller's own zone, in the
// shared interface (*.contract.ts, spec.md, tsconfig/package/vitest config —
// all architect-owned by ZONES), and in files the caller could legally read
// are shown in full. Everything else collapses to a COUNT plus the owning
// role: no path, no line number, no message, no symbol name. A symbol name
// was the exact leak vector, so the shown lines are additionally scrubbed of
// any foreign path token — a second line of defence, the way sanitizeMessage
// is for run_tests.
//
// The verdict stays honest in the one shape that matters: clean-in-your-zone
// while red elsewhere never renders as "OK", or a worker ships on a false
// clean.
//
// Pure: no fs, no spawn, no logging. The tool wiring (extensions/dev-tools.ts)
// resolves the role and writes the guard event.
