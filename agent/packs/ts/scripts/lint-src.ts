// lint-src gate (TN-26-001, BUILD stage): src/** may not switch the type
// checker off. Thin CLI over an ESLint flat config the gate owns outright.
//
//   node lint-src.ts [targetDir]
//
// Exit 0 clean · 1 problems (one greppable line each) · 2 no files matched
// (silence is not success — a gate that matches nothing is a broken gate).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Dogfood Run 7 shipped a runtime contract violation, and
// the type checker had already caught it: `tsc` correctly typed
// `findInvoiceByOperationId(...)` as `Invoice | undefined`, and the builder
// wrote `!` to make the error go away. The type checker is a harness layer,
// and TypeScript ships exactly four switches that turn it off for one
// expression:
//
//   x!            no-non-null-assertion
//   x as T        consistent-type-assertions (assertionStyle: "never")
//   any           no-explicit-any
//   @ts-*         ban-ts-comment
//
// A model under pressure to reach green takes the cheapest path out, so the
// ban has NO exemption list: @ts-expect-error is banned even WITH a
// description (the plausible-sounding description is exactly what a model
// under pressure produces), and `linterOptions.noInlineConfig` means an
// `eslint-disable` comment cannot reopen any of the four from inside the file
// it is meant to police.
//
// `as const` REMAINS LEGAL, and that is not an exemption we granted:
// assertionStyle "never" exempts const assertions itself (verified against
// @typescript-eslint 8.68 — see lint-src.test.ts). `as const` narrows a
// literal; it never widens a type or silences a check. `satisfies` is legal
// for the same reason — it asks the checker a question instead of overruling
// its answer.
//
// Like contract-purity, this gate owns its ENTIRE flat config
// programmatically and consults no project config file: the target project
// never has an eslint config, so nothing in the target tree can weaken these
// rules. *.contract.ts is out of scope — that is the architect's zone, and
// contract-purity polices it.
