// typecheck gate — the worker `typecheck` tool and `bounded gates typecheck` as one
// call (ADR 2026-034).
//
// typecheck.ts runs tsc and redacts machine paths; typecheck-scope.ts narrows
// the diagnostics to what a role may see. Both are pure. What was missing was
// the boundary that joins them and writes the guard event, and it lived only
// in the pi extension — so a second host, or a person at a shell, would have
// had a typecheck that logged nothing and scoped nothing. This is that
// boundary. The role is a parameter: pi resolves it from the session binding,
// the CLI takes `--role`, and an unbound call sees the whole project.
