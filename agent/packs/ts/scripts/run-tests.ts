// run_tests custom tool core (TN-26-001, §"Custom tools" #3).
//
// The builder subagent is blind to test SOURCE but must see failure output to
// debug. run_tests runs the project's vitest suite with the JSON reporter and
// pipes stdout through the ALREADY-BUILT sanitizer (sanitizeTestRun) — the
// only thing that ever reaches the builder is the sanitizer's whitelist:
// test name, status, and a source-scrubbed assertion diff. Same suite binary
// as the orchestrator's gates (vitest), different reporter.
//
// This module owns spawning + shaping; sanitization is NOT reimplemented here.
// The command runner is injectable so the logic is unit-testable against the
// sanitizer's real captured fixtures without spawning vitest.
