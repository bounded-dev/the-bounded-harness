// sign-off gate (TN-26-001, the terminal verdict).
//
//   node sign-off.ts [targetDir] '<findings json>'
//
// GREEN IS NOT THE TERMINAL VERDICT. Dogfood Run 7 shipped a runtime contract
// violation that its own architect had already found: its closing turn reasoned
// through the non-null assertion in `renew`/`changePlan`, observed that the
// replay branch returns an undefined invoice, noted "the test writer didn't test
// it", and then concluded — verbatim — "Given the green gate passed, we can
// declare done." The user-facing report mentioned none of it.
//
// That is not a model failure. A correct, human-grade judgement was made and
// discarded because the loop had exactly one terminal state and it was a gate
// verdict. There was nowhere to put a finding that was not itself a gate
// failure, so the finding evaporated.
//
// So the loop ends here instead. After a green gate the architect must record
// what it saw — AN EMPTY LIST IS A VALID ANSWER, and saying so explicitly is the
// point: it is a claim the architect makes and the guard log keeps, rather than
// a silence nobody can audit later. Cost is one turn.
//
// This gate deliberately does NOT judge the findings. It cannot: whether a
// finding is real is exactly the question the reviewer role (still unbuilt) is
// meant to answer. What it does is make the answer exist, in a greppable line,
// so a later run can ask whether these findings were any good.
//
// Exit 0 recorded · 1 refused (no green to sign off) · 2 misuse (bad payload).
