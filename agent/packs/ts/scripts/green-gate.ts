// green gate (TN-26-001, BUILD verdict, §"Test-runner gates").
//
//   node green-gate.ts [targetDir]
//
// Runs the target project's vitest suite (JSON reporter, via the shared
// run_tests suite runner) AND `tsc --noEmit`, and asserts GREEN from the
// ORCHESTRATOR's own run — never the builder's say-so (TN-26-001 §"Roles and
// flow": "green is asserted from the orchestrator's own run"). The suite must
// run and every test must pass; any failure fails the gate, naming each
// failing test. A suite that could not run (BLOCKED) or executed no tests is a
// fail: green is a positive claim, and silence is not success.
//
// GREEN ALSO REQUIRES A TYPE-CLEAN PROJECT (issue #7). Dogfood Run 3 declared
// "GREEN (22/22)" while tsc still had two errors in the test file: tests pass
// at RUNTIME while the project does not compile, and the builder could not
// have fixed it anyway (blind to tests/**, and the path gate refuses the
// edit). So the gate typechecks too and, on failure, prints ONE route line
// naming the furthest-upstream role that may repair what it found — a
// tests/**-only failure bounces to the test-writer.
//
// GREEN IS BOUND TO A RED. Before running anything, the gate requires a
// red-gate pass that is still standing: recorded after the last contract
// freeze, AND made against the tests as they are now. Green runs on the LIVE
// tree (that is what it is for); red runs on a shadow project, so the two
// verdicts are only about the same work if the tests have not moved between
// them. See `redBindingFor`.
//
// Exit 0 green · 1 not green (one greppable line each) · 2 misuse (target
// unrunnable / bad invocation). Logs one guard event to the target's
// .pi/guard-log.jsonl.
//
// The suite and tsc commands are injectable for testing via PI_GATE_TEST_CMD /
// PI_GATE_TEST_ARGS and PI_GATE_TSC_CMD / PI_GATE_TSC_ARGS (JSON arrays).
