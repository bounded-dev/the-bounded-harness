// design gate (issue #13): the DESIGN phase as ONE call with ONE verdict.
//
//   node design-gate.ts [targetDir] [pattern ...]
//
// purity → scaffold → typecheck → design-review → freeze, in that order,
// stopping at the first failure. Every step is the SAME `run*` function the
// individual gates and the CLI already call — this file sequences and reports,
// and reimplements no check. A composite that re-checked anything would be a
// second, drifting implementation of a gate, which is the one thing the gate
// tools exist to avoid.
//
// The design-review step is the one that does not run anything: it reads the
// guard log and refuses to freeze a design no reviewer has CHALLENGED (issue
// #13 §2). The reviewer's findings are advisory — the architect, the trusted
// author of the spec and contracts, weighs them and decides — so this gate
// never judges one. What it enforces is only that a review EXISTS and that it
// covered the current SET of contract files (ADR 2026-020): a review challenges
// the whole design once, so editing a file it already saw does not un-review
// it — only adding or removing a contract file, which is surface the fresh mind
// never read.
//
// It also REPLAYS the findings verbatim. Not judging a finding is not the same
// as not showing it, and the two were conflated: the step printed "fresh (3
// findings, 1 blocker)" and stopped. The reviewer holds `record_design_review`
// and the architect does not, so the count was the only thing about the review
// the architect could ever see — and r15's architect duly went looking for the
// text, tried `git` three times, and finally revived the reviewer to make it
// recite what this gate was already holding. Printing the claims costs nothing
// and settles them one round-trip earlier; judging them is still nobody's job
// here.
//
// Why a composite at all. The four steps were four architect tool calls with a
// mandatory order, and the order lived in prose. Across dogfood runs that cost
// 3–6 minutes per ticket of round-trips, plus the ordering fumbles prose always
// eventually produces: freezing before scaffolding, scaffolding a contract that
// never passed purity, typechecking nothing because the skeletons were not
// generated yet. A sequence with one entry point cannot be run out of order.
//
// The inner runners keep logging their own guard events — "contract-purity",
// "scaffold", "checksum-gate" — because the phase gate derives the DESIGN
// ordering from exactly those names. This gate adds ONE composite event,
// "design-gate", carrying every step's outcome and wall-clock duration.
//
// Exit 0 pass · 1 block · 2 misuse (a step could not run at all). Logs to the
// target's .bounded/guard-log.jsonl.
//
// NOTE: the purity step's globs resolve from the PROCESS cwd (ESLint's own
// default, shared with the `contract_purity` tool) — run this in the project
// directory, which is what both the tool and the CLI do.

 *
 * That is sound because freshness is the one step whose answer does not depend
 * on any other: it compares the guard log against the CURRENT set of contract
 * files, and neither purity nor scaffolding nor tsc adds or removes those.
 * (Scaffolding writes skeletons and law suites, which no review covers.) It is
 * worth doing because run r14 paid a full purity + scaffold + typecheck pass,
 * repeatedly, only to be told at step four to go and commission the reviewer.
 *
 * It applies only to a re-freeze. A FIRST run has no earlier review to be stale
 * against, so the fast path could only ever report "never reviewed" — which is
 * the normal state of a design being frozen for the first time — and it would
 * report it before scaffolding, which is what has to happen before anything can
 * typecheck at all.
 *
 * HOW THE TWO CASES READ. An early block prints EARLY_NOTICE, then the review's
 * own lines, then the one FAIL line naming the four steps that did not run: the
 * out-of-turn position is stated rather than left to be inferred. An early PASS
 * is SILENT — the pre-flight prints nothing and the step runs again in its own
 * position, where its `design-review: fresh (…)` line appears between typecheck
 * and freeze exactly as it always has. The second evaluation costs one guard-log
 * read and keeps the passing narrative in the canonical order, which is the half
