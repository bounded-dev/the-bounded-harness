// The TypeScript pack's gate registry (ADR 2026-034).
//
// Every artifact gate this pack contributes, as one list the root discovers by
// convention (`packs/*/gates.ts`) and never by name. `bounded gates` reads it for
// its command line; the pi extensions read it for their tool roster; a second
// host reads it for whatever it binds. A gate's name, tool name, description,
// flags and prompt guidance therefore live HERE and nowhere else — the
// descriptions were lifted verbatim from the extensions that used to hold
// them, and the drift tests still pin their phrases.
//
// Each `run` is the same function the pack's own script calls from its `main`,
// so a gate cannot differ by how it was invoked. Runners that still answer in
// the bare `{code, lines}` shape are lifted onto the contract by
// `toGateResult`; their own return types are left alone.
//
// The runners are imported inside `run`, not at the top: the table itself is
// what `bounded gates --list`, a usage message and a tool roster need, and loading
// every gate's machinery (eslint, ts-morph, …) to print a table cost a second
// per invocation. A gate's cost is paid when it runs.
