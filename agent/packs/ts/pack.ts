// The ts pack as a pack DEFINITION (TN-26-005, "two-level sockets").
//
// The core owns language-agnostic mechanisms only, so "ESLint rules" is not a
// core socket and never will be — agent/src/socket-registry.ts contains no word
// for ESLint. The ts pack owns the TypeScript family's gates, so the ts pack
// defines the sockets those gates read, and packs that depend on ts (ts-web
// today) fill them. The core learns that a pack declared a socket and another
// pack filled it, and nothing more.
//
// THREE SOCKETS — two for the gates that lint, one for the delivery pass:
//
//   lintSrcRules             extra rules for the src gate (implementation code)
//   contractPurityOverrides  extra flat-config blocks for the contract gate
//   deliverChecks            read-only checks run at the end of delivery
//                            (ADR 2026-033)
//
// The ts pack's OWN rules are not contributions. `SRC_RULE_IDS` and
// `CONTRACT_RULE_IDS` stay hard-wired in their gates: the gate and the plugin
// are the same pack, a pack contributing to itself through a registry buys
// nothing, and a gate whose base config could be composed away is not a gate.
// The sockets exist for the rules of OTHER packs.
//
// The data-only layer is unaffected. Intake nouns and component return-type
// names stay in `contrib.json` (agent/src/pack-contrib.ts), because the host
// must be able to read those without executing pack code. These two sockets
// carry FUNCTIONS — an ESLint rule is code — which is exactly the line
// TN-26-005 draws between the two halves.

// still defines every token its kit styles through, and that the colours in it
// are readable.
//
// Born WITH its consumer, which is the socket policy (TN-26-005): the step in
// `deliver.ts` and this declaration land in the same change, and neither exists
