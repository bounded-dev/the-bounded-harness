// TN-26-006 zone rule, src/**: the frontend has ONE door to the network.
//
// Runtime imports of `@trpc/client` and `@tanstack/*` are legal only under
// `src/ui/shared/api/`. Type-only imports are legal anywhere.
//
// This is `raw-framework-entry` again, one tier out. That rule gives the
// SERVICE one door because the error taxonomy is code in the shipped runtime;
// this one gives the CLIENT one door because the transport is: the URL, the
// batching, the headers, the single QueryClient whose cache is the app's whole
// shared read model. A second `createTRPCClient` is a second URL to get wrong.
// A second `new QueryClient` is worse — it splits the cache in half, and
// nothing fails: one half of the app simply stops seeing the other half's
// writes, intermittently, in a way that reads as a backend problem.
//
// It also buys the thing the reference set is actually for: components that can
// be tested. A component reaching `@tanstack/react-query` directly has a
// transport soldered into it; one reaching the door's `useServiceClient()` can
// be rendered under a provider holding a fake, and knows no difference.
//
// TYPE-ONLY IMPORTS ARE FREE EVERYWHERE, exactly as in raw-framework-entry: a
// `TRPCClientError` in a signature moves no bytes and opens no socket.
//
// The two packs' rules meet here and do not overlap: `@trpc/server` belongs to
// the ts pack's rule, `@trpc/client` to this one.
