// The ts-web reference layout, as text (TN-26-006 B1).
//
// WHY THESE ARE STRINGS AND NOT FILES. The ts pack's one shipped artifact —
// `packs/ts/api/service-runtime.ts` — is a real file, copied verbatim, and it
// typechecks inside the harness because it imports nothing but `@trpc/server`.
// A frontend skeleton cannot be that: `main.tsx` imports an `App` the target's
// own contract has not declared yet, `client.tsx` imports the router type out of
// the target's own service contract, and `app.css` is not TypeScript at all.
// Files that cannot resolve inside the harness cannot typecheck inside it
// either, so storing them as files would buy nothing and cost a tsconfig full
// of exclusions.
//
// The verification happens where it is actually available instead: the
// generator's suite emits the whole layout into a temp project, symlinks the
// harness's `node_modules`, writes the tsconfig a web target uses, and runs the
// real `tsc` over it — the red gate's shadow-project trick, applied to a
// generator. The pinned web stack in the harness's package.json is what makes
// that possible, and it is the same pin list `contrib.json` records for deliver.
//
// EVERY EXPORT HERE IS THE FILE'S BODY WITHOUT ITS MARKER. `markerFor` in
// new-web-app.ts prepends the marker in the comment syntax the extension
// demands, so the marker sentence has exactly one source.

//
// A minimal shadcn-style set: button, card, input, label — joined below by the
// four LAYOUT primitives r24 proved were missing (page-shell, badge, stat,
// data-list). Faithful in SPIRIT —
// copy-in components you own, styled entirely with Tailwind utilities over
// semantic tokens, composed rather than configured — and deliberately not a
// transcription: these are pack-owned, marker-carrying, and never hand-edited,
// so restyling happens through the `@theme` block in app.css and nowhere else
// (ratified at the 2026-09-14 grill).
//
// DEPENDENCIES CHOSEN, AND WHY:
//
//   clsx + tailwind-merge — KEPT, as `cn()`. Not convenience: `twMerge` is what
//     makes a caller's `className="bg-destructive"` actually beat the
//     component's own `bg-primary`, because Tailwind classes have no
//     specificity story of their own and the last one in the string wins only
//     if something de-duplicates the conflict. Without it, "pass a className to
//     override" silently does nothing — the single most confusing failure mode
//     a component kit can have. Roughly 3KB for the pair.
//
//   class-variance-authority — DROPPED. It is the idiomatic shadcn choice, and
//     for four components it buys a dependency, a DSL and an inference story to
//     replace two `Record<Variant, string>` lookups that any reader can follow
//     at a glance. The brief's own instruction was to keep dependencies minimal
//     and take cva only if genuinely needed; with one component having variants,
//     it is not. Revisit when the kit grows compound variants, which is the
//     thing a record cannot express.
//
//   @radix-ui/* — DROPPED for this set. Real shadcn reaches for Radix the
//     moment a component needs focus management or a portal (dialog, popover,
//     select). None of these four do: button, card, input and label are all
//     native elements with classes on them, and a headless-primitives
//     dependency that nothing yet needs is a dependency a project inherits
//     forever. The day the reference set grows a dialog, Radix is the answer
//     and it comes in pinned, like everything else.

// --- The layout primitives (TN-26-006, "Styling: anatomy enforced, identity

//
// WHY THESE FOUR EXIST. Dogfood r24 delivered a behaviourally perfect,
// visually bare screen: 77 green tests over a page that was a stack of
// unstyled `<p>` elements. The builder was not lazy and not blind to the kit —
// it wrote ZERO className, because nothing in the kit it composed produced a

// pieces INSIDE a screen; a screen is what the run had to invent, and inventing
// was exactly what the reference set exists to stop.
//
// So the fix is structural rather than instructional: make the styled path the
// DEFAULT path. A builder that composes PageShell → DataList → Card → Stat →
// Badge gets rhythm, measure, hierarchy and tone for free, and writes no
// className at all — which is also what makes the `tokens-only-styling` rule a
// small ask rather than a straitjacket.
//
// EVERYTHING HERE IS GENERIC — the kit is `shared`, and Law 1 (downward-only
// imports) means it can never learn a domain. That is why the Badge's variants
// are TONES ("positive", "caution", "critical", "neutral") and not bands,
// grades, severities or statuses: a tone is a reading of a value that any
// domain can map onto, and the mapping lives in `entities/` where the domain
