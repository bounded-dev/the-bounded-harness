// The driver's eye (TN-26-006, "Taste stays judged, not gated").
//
//   node render-screenshot.ts [targetDir]
//
// Builds a web target, serves the build output on an ephemeral port,
// screenshots it, and writes `.bounded/render/<timestamp>.png` into the target.
//
// ADVISORY, ALWAYS. It never blocks anything and it exits 0 whatever happens —
// a missing browser, a failing build, a project that is not a frontend at all
// all produce one "unavailable: <why>" line and a zero exit. Visual quality has
// no gate and never will (TN-26-006); what a reviewer and a user lack is not a
// verdict but PIXELS, and this is the cheapest honest way to put some in front
// of them. It is the visual twin of `mutation_score`: measured, reported, never
// a transition.
//
// WHY A STATIC SERVER AND NOT file:// . A built Vite app loads its JS as a
// module from an absolute path, and `file://` refuses module scripts
// cross-origin — the screenshot would be a blank page with a console error
// nobody sees. Forty lines of `node:http` is the whole cost of a real origin,
// and it adds no dependency to the harness or to any target.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT AN ARCHITECT TOOL. Every gate the architect runs is a named
// tool because the architect has no `bash` — and those tools are wired in the
// harness core, which may not name a technology (TN-26-005). A pack-contributed
// TOOL is the missing socket: the core would own "a pack may expose a driver
// tool", packs would fill it, and `render_screenshot` would arrive in the
// architect's toolset only for projects composing ts-web. That socket does not
// exist yet, so this script is DRIVER-SIDE today: run it from the session that
// has a shell, at wrap, and put the PNG in front of the reviewer. TN-26-006's
// Phase C lists it as the next socket, born with this consumer.
