/**
 * Path-gate extension (TN-26-001 Phase 2)
 *
 * A `tool_call` hook that enforces the developer-stage blindness matrix for a
 * pipeline role: architect / test-writer / builder / reviewer. For those roles it runs
 * the pure decision core (src/path-policy.ts via src/path-gate.ts), blocks
 * out-of-zone reads/edits/writes/searches, and records each block in the
 * target project's guard log. In a project-local installation, a normal root
 * session is the read-only team lead. In the global harness a normal session
 * remains ungated by this extension.
 *
 * It also installs a `session_start` hook that REMOVES the role's forbidden
 * tools from the model's visible toolset (pi.setActiveTools), so a directly
 * launched session gets the same "the tool was never there" property a
 * subagent gets free from its frontmatter allowlist. The tool_call refusals
 * become the backstop they were always described as.
 *
 * ── Role source (the key design decision) ────────────────────────────────
 * Subagents run as SEPARATE `pi` child processes (pi-subagents spawns them),
 * so they do not share a process with the orchestrator — but every child
 * inherits the parent's `process.env`, so a parent-set env var is NOT
 * per-agent: it would tag every child, of every role, identically. There is
 * also no per-agent env injected by pi-subagents (no `PI_SUBAGENT_AGENT_NAME`
 * or equivalent), and no `env:` frontmatter field.
 *
 * The mechanism pi ACTUALLY supports per-subagent is `subagentOnlyExtensions`
 * in the agent's frontmatter: extension paths loaded ONLY in that agent's
 * spawned child session (pi-subagents passes them as `--extension` args). So
 * each pipeline agent binds its role by loading a distinct per-role loader
 * from ./path-gate/ (architect.ts / test-writer.ts / builder.ts), each of
 * which calls installPathGate(pi, "<role>"). The role is baked into WHICH
 * extension the agent loads — deterministic, per-subagent, and impossible for
 * a normal session to trip (it never loads those files).
 *
 * Example agent frontmatter (agents/architect.md):
 *   subagentOnlyExtensions: <harness>/hosts/pi/extensions/path-gate/architect.ts
 *
 * ── Fallback (documented limitation) ─────────────────────────────────────
 * This file also auto-loads ambiently (hosts/pi/extensions/*.ts). Its default export
 * binds NO role, so it is inert unless a role is found via the fallbacks:
 *   1. BOUNDED_DEV_STAGE_ROLE env var, then
 *   2. a `.bounded/dev-stage-role` file in the project cwd.
 * Both are PROCESS/CWD-global: they cannot distinguish two roles operating in
 * the same project at once, and env leaks to nested children. They exist only
 * so the gate can be exercised without a full subagent launch; the
 * subagentOnlyExtensions loaders are the real mechanism. Prefer them.
