/**
 * Developer-stage worker tools (TN-26-001, §"Custom tools" #3).
 *
 * The tools the non-architect roles get in place of `bash`. None of them is
 * held by every role: the frontmatter allowlist decides who holds what, and
 * `ROLE_TOOLS` in src/path-policy.ts is the canonical statement of that (the
 * path gate refuses the ones that are one role's alone, as a backup layer).
 *
 *   remove(path, cwd?)      — delete one file, inside the caller's write zones.
 *   run_tests(cwd?)         — BUILDER ONLY. Runs the project's vitest suite
 *                             with the JSON reporter and returns ONLY sanitized
 *                             results (failure names + assertion diffs; no code
 *                             frames, stacks, paths, or console).
 *   typecheck(cwd?)         — runs `tsc --noEmit` and returns pass/fail +
 *                             diagnostics with absolute machine paths redacted
 *                             AND scoped to the calling role: a worker sees its
 *                             own zone and the shared interface in full, and
 *                             another role's errors as a count plus an owner.
 *                             Same blindness run_tests already enforces; the
 *                             role comes from the path gate's own binding, and
 *                             the tool exposes no way to claim another.
 *   record_design_review    — REVIEWER ONLY. Records the pre-freeze review of
 *     (findings, cwd?)        spec + contracts in the guard log, checksum-bound
 *                             to the bytes reviewed. The reviewer has no write
 *                             zone at all, so this is the only mark it leaves.
 *
 * Only `remove` is written here: it is a host tool (the path gate vets it),
 * not an artifact gate. The other three are gate-registry entries
 * (`packs/ts/gates.ts`, ADR 2026-034) registered through `lib/gate-tools.ts`,
 * so their names, descriptions, parameters, guard events and verdict lines are
 * the same ones `bounded gates` serves from a shell — this file says only which
 * entries the worker roles hold. A normal session holds none of these agents'
 * allowlists and simply never calls them.
