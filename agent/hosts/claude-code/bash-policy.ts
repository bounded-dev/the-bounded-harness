// Bash policy for the Claude Code host (ADR 2026-029).
//
// In pi no role holds a shell: the gates, git and sleep are NAMED tools, and
// `bash` is in every role's FORBIDDEN_TOOLS. Claude Code has no way to add a
// named tool to a subagent, so the gates are reached the one way they can be —
// `pi-gates <gate>` through Bash — and Bash becomes the thing this file
// narrows: a role may run exactly the commands that stand in for the pi tools
// its ROLE_TOOLS entry names, and nothing else. One list, derived, never a
// second: the set of gates a role may invoke here IS its ROLE_TOOLS minus the
// tools that have a Claude Code tool or a bash carrier of their own.
//
// The narrowing is deliberately stricter than "is the first word allowed".
// A shell string is a program, and `pi-gates typecheck; cat tests/x.test.ts`
// starts with an allowed word. So the command is first read the way a POSIX
// shell would, quote by quote, and refused the moment it uses anything that
// would make it more than one plain argv: separators, pipes, redirects,
// substitutions, globs, brace and tilde expansion, backslash escapes, an env
// assignment prefix. What survives is a single argv the shell will pass
// verbatim, and THAT is judged. A refusal says which construct and which
// commands this role may run instead, because a refused command costs a turn
// and a vague refusal costs several.
//
// An allowed `pi-gates` call is also where the bound role and the host cross
// into the CLI process: the hook rewrites the command with a
// `PI_HOST=claude-code PI_DEV_STAGE_ROLE=<role>` prefix (`updatedInput`).
// `sessionRole()` reads the role before the role file, so a role-scoped gate
// view (typecheck) sees the role the definition bound rather than whatever
// file the project holds, and the CLI records which host ran it. This module
// only refuses the model's own attempts at the same thing — an env prefix it
// typed, of either name, a `--role` it passed — and reports the carrier, so
// the hook knows which allow to decorate. Pure: no fs, no process, no
// logging. The hook logs.
