# Claude Code host adapter

The developer stage's **capability constraints** (ADR 2026-034, Tier B) for
Claude Code: the path gate and the phase gate as a `PreToolUse` hook, the tool
strip as generated `.claude/agents/*.md` `tools:` allowlists, and the role
binding through each agent definition's own `hooks:`. The **artifact gates**
(Tier A) are not here — they are `bounded gates <gate>`, one CLI for every host,
and this adapter only decides who may run which of them.

Everything here is thin wiring over the same pure cores the pi extensions
use: `decide()` (`src/path-policy.ts`), `checkSubagentCall()`
(`src/phase-gate.ts`), `sessionRole()` (`src/path-gate.ts`). There is no second
rule set. Where Claude Code differs from pi — it has no way to register a named
tool, so the gates are reached through Bash — the difference is one derived
list (`bash-policy.ts`) and one mapping (`PI_TO_CLAUDE_TOOLS` in
`render-agents.ts`), both pinned to `ROLE_TOOLS` by drift tests.

**Status: the developer stage has been exercised; the new lead entry has not
yet had a live run.** Fixture tests spawn the existing pipeline hook and
installer against Claude Code hook payloads. Live developer-stage
runs delivered in [Run 25](../../../docs/dogfood/runs/run-26-025-the-first-claude-code-harness-run.md),
[Run 27](../../../docs/dogfood/runs/run-26-027-opus-vs-kimi-both-harnessed.md), and
[Run 29](../../../docs/dogfood/runs/run-26-029-non-technical-ui-service-persistence.md).
Run 29 also exposed missing shared-service delivery despite green gates;
completing the host workflow does not establish application completeness.
The lead-to-nested-architect path is implemented from documented Claude Code
capabilities and still needs a live run before its behavior can be claimed.

## Files

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `bootstrap-hook.ts` | Dependency-free project entry. Until setup completion and both dependency trees are present it admits exact setup at the project root and confines local reads to that project; afterward it invokes the full hook. |
| `path-gate-hook.ts` | The `PreToolUse` hook. Reads the call as JSON on stdin; prints a deny decision, a rewritten local command, or nothing. `--role <role>` binds a subagent. A project-local main session defaults to the read-only lead; the global installer retains the legacy `.bounded/dev-stage-role` fallback. |
| `tool-map.ts` | Claude Code tool call → pi tool call(s): `Read {file_path}` → `read {path}`, `Agent {subagent_type}` → `subagent {agent}`, and so on. |
| `bash-policy.ts` | What a role may put through Bash: `bounded gates <gate>` for the gates in its `ROLE_TOOLS`, plus `git`, `sleep`, `rm <path>` where the role holds the pi tool. Everything else refused. |
| `render-agents.ts` | Generates `.claude/agents/<role>.md` from `agents/<role>.md`: `tools:` from `ROLE_TOOLS`, `hooks:` binding the role, the pi brief verbatim under a host preamble. |
| `project-install.ts` | Adds the read-only scout, team-lead skill, and main-session lead instructions to an initialized project. |
| `install.ts` | Writes the four developer-stage agents, links the `developer-stage` skill into `.claude/skills/`, and merges the ambient hook into `.claude/settings.json`. |

## What it enforces

- **Path gate**, identical to pi's: Read/Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit/
  Glob/Grep are mapped to `read`/`edit`/`write`/`find`/`grep` and judged by
  `decide()` against the role's zones. A blind role cannot read the other
  side's work product; every role's writes are confined to its zone; `.git`
  and `.bounded` are protected as in pi.
- **Model tiers** (ADR 2026-022), planned by the same core as pi's
  (`planModelTier` over `.bounded/dev-stage-models.json`): an allowed spawn of a
  pipeline role is rewritten to the seat's tier, translated into the Agent
  tool's vocabulary (`anthropic/claude-opus-5:high` → `opus`), and a
  caller-passed model is replaced, loudly, in the guard log. A configured
  tier this host cannot run (a non-anthropic model) refuses the spawn
  rather than quietly seating the session default.
- **Phase gate** on `Agent`: an `Agent` call with `subagent_type: builder` is
  a `subagent` launch of the builder, judged by `checkSubagentCall()` against
  the project's guard log — no contracts, no spec, no design gate, no spawn.
  Before that, the `subagent_type` itself is judged: only the four generated
  definitions carry a tool strip and a bound hook, so a commission of
  anything else — `general-purpose`, `Explore`, a user's own agent, pi's
  `delegate`, or no `subagent_type` at all — is refused as an unbound
  subagent, in the phase gate's own words, and logged as its
  `spawn-refused` block. Without this, `Agent {subagent_type:
  "general-purpose"}` would be a full-toolset, hook-free proxy for the
  architect, which is exactly what pi's `delegate` refusal prevents.
- **Tool strip**, as `tools:` in the generated agent definitions: a worker
  never sees `Agent`; the reviewer never sees `Write` or `Edit`. Pinned to
  `ROLE_TOOLS` by `render-agents.test.ts`, the way `agent-config-drift.test.ts`
  pins pi's frontmatter.
- **Bash narrowed to the carriers.** The command is read the way a POSIX
  shell reads it and refused if it is more than one plain argv: `;`, `&`,
  `|`, `(`, redirects, `$`, backticks, backslashes, globs, braces, tilde,
  comments, an unterminated quote, an env-assignment prefix. What survives is
  allowed only if it is one of:
  - `bounded gates <gate> …` where `<gate>` (hyphens or underscores) is in the
    role's `ROLE_TOOLS` and is not a file tool — so the builder may run
    `run-tests` and `typecheck`, the architect every gate, the reviewer
    `record-design-review` and `typecheck`; `bounded gates --list|--help` always;
  - read-only `git …` for roles holding `git` (the architect), as defined by
    the shared Git policy. The subcommand is the first word
    after the four global options the policy passes (`--no-pager`, `-P`,
    `--no-optional-locks`, `--literal-pathspecs`); any other leading option
    is refused by name, because a global that takes a value (`-C <dir>`,
    `--git-dir <dir>`) would put its value where the subcommand is read and
    slip `config core.hooksPath …` or `bisect run …` past the checks;
  - `sleep <1-120>` for roles holding `sleep` (the architect);
  - `rm <one literal path>` judged as a pi `remove`, so the write zones apply.
  A refusal is one line: `path-gate: <role> may not run '<cmd>': <why> — …`,
  using pi's own `forbiddenWhy` sentence where pi has one. `--role` and
  `--findings-file` are refused anywhere in a `bounded gates` argv: the host
  supplies the role, and findings are passed inline. Gate names are
  hyphenated (`bounded gates red-gate`); the pi spelling (`red_gate`) is accepted.
- **The bound role and the host reach the gate process.** An allowed
  `bounded gates …` is answered with `permissionDecision: "allow"` and an
  `updatedInput` whose command is `BOUNDED_HOST=claude-code BOUNDED_DEV_STAGE_ROLE=<role>
  <original command>`; the rest of the tool input is kept. `sessionRole()`
  reads the role variable before the `.bounded/dev-stage-role` file, so a gate
  that scopes its output by role (`typecheck`) sees the role the definition
  bound, whatever file the project holds; and the CLI records `host
  claude-code` in the guard log rather than `host none`, which is what a
  `bounded gates` with no `BOUNDED_HOST` records. The policy has already refused every
  construct that could make the prefix anything but an env assignment, and a
  prefix the model types itself — either variable — is refused. `git`,
  `sleep` and `rm` are allowed silently — nothing in them reads a role.
- **Role binding by which definition loads.** `.claude/agents/<role>.md`
  carries the hook with `--role <role>` in its own `hooks:`; those fire only
  inside that subagent. The model cannot change its role: `.claude/**` is in
  no role's write zone, so the definitions and `settings.json` are unwritable
  from inside a run.
- **Guard log.** Every block, the run-start marker (the architect's first
  call, once — the log is the latch, since each hook run is a fresh process),
  and every hook error land in `<project>/.bounded/guard-log.jsonl`, the same file
  and the same event shapes pi writes.
- **Fails open for reads, closed for writes — loudly either way.** Malformed
  stdin, an unreadable project, a bug: one line goes to stderr and an `error`
  event goes to the guard log. Then, if the payload named a tool that
  mutates (`Bash`, `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `NotebookEdit`, `Agent`,
  `Task`), the call is denied with a reason that says the hook errored; a
  read, or a payload too broken to name a tool, is allowed. A hook that
  could brick a session would be disabled, and a disabled gate is worse
  than a visible gap — but a gate that waves a write through on its own
  error is not a gate.

## What it does not enforce (honest limits)

- **The tier's thinking level.** The model tier is enforced (see above), but
  a pattern's `:high`-style thinking suffix has no Agent-tool equivalent
  here and is dropped; the guard line shows the full pattern so the loss is
  visible. The phase gate's tier-resolvability check still runs without a
  registry snapshot (⇒ "cannot tell", never a refusal), exactly as in pi —
  the host's own runnability check replaces it at spawn time.
- **Role-scoped views are the CLI's to apply.** The hook hands the bound
  role to the gate process (`BOUNDED_DEV_STAGE_ROLE`), and the registry's
  `typecheck` entry resolves `sessionRole(cwd)` when no `--role` is given —
  so the builder's `bounded gates typecheck` is scoped exactly as pi's `typecheck`
  tool is. What the hook still cannot do is see or edit a gate's OUTPUT:
  a gate that prints something role-sensitive without consulting the role
  prints it here too. `run-tests` sanitizes inside the pack script, so that
  view is the same on both hosts.
- **`bounded gates` arguments are not judged.** `bounded gates run-tests ../other`
  runs a gate against another directory and writes to that project's guard
  log. No gate echoes an arbitrary file, so this is not a read channel, but
  it is a way to act outside the project the hook was installed in.
- **Git is read-only in every host.** The architect can inspect status and
  history through the shared Git policy. Mutating commands are refused because
  they can rewrite protected files without using the file tools or their path
  gate. The Claude Bash carrier additionally refuses shell syntax and Git
  options that run external commands.
- **The main session has no tool strip.** In an initialized project, the
  ambient hook judges every main-session tool as the lead and denies unknown
  tools. In the global installer, a legacy `.bounded/dev-stage-role` still
  selects a direct role; that ambient mode cannot strip tools it does not map.
- **The project hook also sees subagent calls.** A generated subagent's own
  frontmatter hook binds its role. The project settings hook stands down when
  the `PreToolUse` payload carries `agent_id`, which identifies a child call;
  `agent_type` alone can also describe a directly launched main session.
  If `agent_id` is absent, the project hook applies the lead
  policy to the subagent too and blocks its writes. This fails closed but can
  stall the architect's loop; inspect hook payloads before claiming an end to
  end Claude Code delivery through the new entry path.
- **Lexical paths, as in pi.** The gate normalises paths without resolving
  symlinks. No role can create one (no `ln`, no shell), so the surface is the
  same as pi's.
- **`bounded gates` is resolved on PATH.** The policy accepts the bare name only,
  and no role's write zone is on a normal PATH, but a PATH that includes a
  project directory would let a role's own `bounded gates` be the one that runs.
- **`bounded gates` is auto-approved by design; everything else keeps Claude
  Code's own prompts.** An explicit `permissionDecision: "allow"` bypasses
  Claude Code's permission prompt, and an allowed `bounded gates …` is answered
  that way on purpose: the policy has already proved the argv is one plain
  command naming a gate the role holds, and the rewrite is the only way to
  hand it the role. Every other allow — `git`, `sleep`, `rm`, the file
  tools, anything unmapped — is silent (no output), so Claude Code's own
  prompts stay in place for it. A deny from the hook is final.

## Install

Requires Node 22.18+ (`node` runs `.ts` directly) and project-local Bounded
gate commands. The repository-only `agent/scripts/bounded-init` wires the
developer machine; initialized projects carry their own adapter and commands.

```sh
node <harness>/hosts/claude-code/install.ts <project>
```

Writes `<project>/.claude/agents/{scout,architect,test-writer,builder,reviewer}.md`,
copies the `team-lead` skill, and links `<harness>/skills/developer-stage` at
`<project>/.claude/skills/developer-stage` (the architect's brief opens by
loading that skill, and Claude Code reads skills from the project's
`.claude/skills/`, not from `~/.pi/agent/skills`), and adds the ambient hook
and `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_TASKS=1` plus
`CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=0` to
`<project>/.claude/settings.json`. The latter makes each reviewer and worker
return its result to the architect before the next phase; Claude Code runs
these roles sequentially. Other settings are preserved, and a conflicting
value is refused. Idempotent; prints one line per file: `wrote`,
`unchanged`, `linked <path> -> <target>`, or — where the platform refuses a
symlink — `copied <path> (symlink refused: …)`, in which case the copy
carries a `.bounded-harness-generated` marker file and must be re-installed after
the skill changes. It refuses to overwrite an agent file that lacks the
`# generated by bounded-harness` marker, a real `.claude/skills/developer-stage`
directory that is not a symlink and lacks that marker file (someone's own
skill), and a `settings.json` it cannot parse — exit 1, nothing written.
Re-run it after editing `agents/<role>.md` or `ROLE_TOOLS`: the rendered
files are derived and carry no hand edits.

The installer writes an **absolute harness path** into `settings.json`, into
each agent file's `hooks:` command, and into the skill symlink. `.claude/` in
a pipeline project is therefore generated per machine and belongs in that
project's `.gitignore`, next to `.bounded/`; a clone re-runs the installer.

## Running a ticket

Initialized projects open the main Claude Code session as a read-only team
lead. The installer gives it the team-lead skill and a read-only scout
definition. The user states the outcome or ticket without naming roles. The
lead inspects the project, runs exact dependency setup before the first run,
prepares the work item with `bounded lead prepare [ticket]`, and commissions an
ordinary unnamed architect subagent. It does not edit product files.

Current Claude Code supports nested ordinary subagents: the architect's
generated definition gives it `Agent`, and it can commission reviewer,
test-writer, and builder as nested subagents. Their generated definitions
bind each role's tools and `PreToolUse` hook. Project settings keep those
calls in the foreground. Agent teams remain disabled; this route does not
depend on teammate hook behavior. See the [Claude Code subagent
documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents) for nested agent
and definition hook behavior.

The lead hook admits the project-local command
`bash .bounded/harness/scripts/bounded gates --list` for discovery,
`npm run bounded:setup` before a prepared run, and
`bash .bounded/harness/scripts/bounded lead prepare [ticket|--new [ticket]]`
for run preparation. The lead uses `--new` for a fresh work item after
delivery, adding the number when the issue is already tracked, and omits it
for a follow-up to the current item.
It refuses arbitrary Bash and file edits even when an old
`.bounded/dev-stage-role` names an architect. The shared lead policy requires
a prepared ticket before an architect commission.
