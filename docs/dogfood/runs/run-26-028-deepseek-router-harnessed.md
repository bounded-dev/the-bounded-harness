# Run 28 — DeepSeek V4, harnessed on pi: a third open lineage, delivered clean (2026-09-22)

The first harnessed run on **DeepSeek** — a different lab and lineage from
Kimi — closing the open-model trio (Kimi, now DeepSeek; Qwen/GLM next).
Renewable-site contract prompt, pi host, tiers **deepseek-v4-pro** (judgment)
/ **deepseek-v4-flash** (workers). Delivered **286/286 green, 98% mutation,
66 guard events, ~39 minutes** — the fastest arm and the largest blind suite
to date.

## Two false starts first (both fixed, both instructive)

This run took three launches; the first two are findings, not noise:

1. **The architect could not read its own skill files.** Every open-model
   arm had opened by being refused its own `SKILL.md`; DeepSeek *thrashed* on
   it (a dozen blocks, web searches, doc fetches) badly enough to confound
   the run. Root cause: the `hosts/pi` restructure (ADR 2026-035) left
   `HARNESS_ROOT` walking up too few directory levels, so it pointed at
   `hosts/pi` and the "a role may read its own skill files" allowance never
   matched. Fixed (depth corrected, value exported and pinned by
   `hosts/pi/discovery.test.ts`); the code comment had even said "every
   dogfood run so far" hit this. The clean rerun opened with **zero**
   skill-read blocks.
2. **The tier pointed at a model that 404'd.** `fireworks/…/models/
   deepseek-v4-pro` and `-flash` listed in `pi --list-models` but returned
   404 (not deployed) the moment a seat spawned — a catalog entry is not a
   served endpoint. The served ones are the **routers**
   (`routers/deepseek-pro-latest`, which resolves to the dated
   `deepseek-v4-pro-0813`). The standing rule is now in
   [dogfooding.md](../dogfooding.md#running-one): validate deployability,
   not just listing; `patternIsKnown` only checks registry membership.

The good harness moment in that second start: hitting the dead model, the
architect tried to **self-heal by rewriting `.bounded/dev-stage-models.json`**
— and the path gate refused (`.bounded/ is read-only for every role,
including me`), so it escalated to "environment/owner issue" instead of
silently swapping models. An agent was stopped from editing its own run's
provenance. Working as intended.

## The clean run, measured

| | value | vs Run 27 |
|---|---|---|
| Blind tests (red) | **286** | > sonnet 280, kimi 210 |
| Delivered | 286/286 green | same as both |
| Mutation | **98%** (39/40) | opus 100, kimi 100 |
| Escape attempts | **1** (one `as any`) | kimi 3 (21 hatches + test-edit + delegate) |
| Design phase | clean freeze, no purity bounce, no review-missing block | cleaner than opus (review-missing) or kimi (26 purity problems) |
| Wall clock | ~39 min | fastest arm |

DeepSeek navigated the pipeline the most smoothly of any open model: no
purity struggle, no test-editing attempt, a single escape hatch (vs kimi's
twenty-one), and the largest, most thorough blind red. It was slow to *start*
(~9 min of quiet high-reasoning before writing a spec) but efficient once
moving.

## The three guard questions

1. **Deterministic corrections.** `red-gate BLOCK: 15 boundary gaps`
   (between sonnet's 5 and kimi's 23 — a mid-tier worker's coverage);
   `green-gate BLOCK: 1 escape hatch` caught deepseek-flash's single `as any`
   and made it implement honestly; routine typecheck bounces. No design-gate
   review-missing block — DeepSeek commissioned the reviewer *before* trying
   to freeze, unprompted.
2. **Probes.** Both workers refused their blind-zone searches (test-writer on
   `src`, builder on `tests`) — the blindness, both directions. The
   architect probed pi's own source and the harness root (correctly refused,
   out of zone), but did **not** reach for `delegate` or a batch spawn the
   way kimi did.
3. **Circumvention.** None. One escape hatch, caught. Tracked config intact.

## The one surviving mutant — a precise, real gap

98%, not 100%, and the single survivor is exact:
**`src/contracts/sweep.ts:14  < → <=`** inside a `compareText` sort helper
(`if (a < b) return -1`). Mutating `<` to `<=` misorders the **equal-key
tie-break** — and no test in DeepSeek's 286 exercises two notifications with
identical sort keys, so the mutant lives. It is the tie-breaking equality
case in an internal comparator: subtle, unobservable unless a tie occurs,
and precisely the kind of gap a **reference test** (TN-26-008) showing "test
the equal case in a comparator" would close. Mutation is measured not gated,
so this shipped — but at 98% it is still well above the ungated 93% baseline
(Run 26), because the red gate forced the boundary coverage that got it
there.

## Model-tier injection on served endpoints

`reviewer/architect → designModel (routers/deepseek-pro-latest)`,
`test-writer/builder → workerModel (routers/deepseek-flash-latest)` — the
same core (`planModelTier`) that tiers the Claude and Kimi arms, now proven
on a third provider path, resolving through Fireworks' router endpoints.
Resumes logged `untierable` as designed.

## A prompt-injection attempt, refused — and the gate behind it

The architect (deepseek-pro) reported that several **subagent-resume results
carried injected text** urging it to write an unrelated `commit-to-file.md`,
and it ignored them and finished only the ticket. The source was not the web
— it was the worker→architect **resume channel** (16:38–16:42), i.e. content
that arrived as a weaker worker's (deepseek-flash) output surfaced through
`subagent … resume`. Whether a genuine adversarial payload or a confused
worker emitting instruction-shaped text, the architect correctly treated
worker output as **data, not instructions**, and refused.

The load-bearing point is the backstop: even had the architect complied, the
**path gate would have refused the write** — the architect's write zone is
`spec.md` + `*.contract.ts` only, so a `commit-to-file.md` write is out of
zone and blocked. The injection was defeated twice — the model declined it,
and the mechanism would have stopped it regardless. Defense in depth, with
the deterministic layer as the one that does not depend on the model getting
it right.

Corroboration worth noting: the architect's own sign-off independently
flagged "the sweep's sort comparator equal-key case isn't pinned" — the
exact gap the mutation gate caught as the lone survivor. The human-readable
review and the mechanical score agree on the precise hole.

## Bottom line

Three open lineages now run harnessed (Kimi, DeepSeek) and all deliver
spec-correct, high-mutation code the gates forced out of them. DeepSeek is
the cleanest open-model run so far — one escape hatch, no cheating, the
largest blind suite — and its single mutation survivor is a textbook case
for why reference tests earn their place. The two false starts hardened the
harness (the skill-read fix) and the operating rules (validate model
deployability), both now in the repo.
